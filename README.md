# EldenVins Nightreign - HUD Alterations

[NexusMods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/477)

ELDENVINS is a super awesome mod that you should absolutely try out for yourself. One of the major things to get used
to is that certain HUD elements have moved, likely to accommodate the much wider FOV that is necessary for seeing all
the neat spells and VFX. This can quickly become an issue if you aren't aware the condition gauges for status effects
have moved, and before you know it you're poisoned, rotted, frostbitten, or overcome with madness...

This extremely simple mod reverts the X and Y coordinates of the condition gauges back to the vanilla nightreign
location, roughly in the center of the screen.

## Alterations Made

1. Condition Gauges Position:
   - Moved the condition gauges (poison, rot, frostbite, madness) back to their original vanilla nightreign
     position at the center of the screen.
   - This change helps players easily monitor their status effects without having to adjust to the new HUD layout
     introduced by the EldenVins mod.
